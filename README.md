# Premier League Data Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of the English Premier League (EPL) player statistics using Python. The goal is to explore key metrics to understand individual and team performance â€” with a focus on goal scoring, passing accuracy, dribbling success, and defensive contributions.

---

##  Objectives
- Identify top performers in goals, assists, tackles, and other key metrics.
- Understand how passing and dribbling influence progression and attack.
- Analyze the strongest offensive and defensive teams.
- Explore correlations between key football performance indicators.

---

##  Dataset
The dataset includes a wide range of player attributes:
- Player Name & Team
- Nationality, Position, Age
- Minutes Played, Goals, Assists
- Shots, Dribbles, Tackles, Cards
- xG, xAG, Progressive Passes & Carries
- Passing stats and more
